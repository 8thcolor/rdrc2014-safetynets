# RDRC 2014: Safety Nets: learn to code with confidence

This repository contains the code illustrating the talk given by me
(Christophe Philemotte) at RedDotRubyConference 2014: Safety Nets: Learn to
code with confidence.

Each commit corresponds to a step in the illustration and will allow you to
reproduce it step by step.

## A simple invoicing application

As illustration, we'll implement a simple invoicing application. This is a
common use case that everybody should easily relate to. Please consider that
it's not a real application. It's oversimplified as the goal is to support the
concept of safety nets without digging too deep in each kind of. As
consequence, some design could be certainly be improved.
